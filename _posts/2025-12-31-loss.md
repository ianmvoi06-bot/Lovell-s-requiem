title: "Loss Is Life"
---

Loss is life.

Life is loss.

No self control on my own
Alone in nights I loathe
When my will goes missing

In my head, in my lungs
In my ribcage I love love
Enough for comfort knowing
Loss goes with it.

2 bullets brought a symbolism
Of flesh and soul, the trigger
My love and death the result

Many nights grown cold
Now my wrists gone cold
With the blade in my hand
Stained red like the lips that
Didn't listen

State of dissociation I mistook for peace
Lost deep in resonance now craving for
Love I once cherished

Saccharine, iris green as the envy I harbored
Crystallised thoughts of meaning I once saw as truth.
Dissonance in your breath, like poetry your heart, beat.

And everything that I see bleak like the
Grey that rot. Derealization in my thoughts
Don't think my mental can handle

Everywhere that I go loss follows like life eternal
I get swallowed by the burning cradle

An ode to the dead, say a prayer for the lost in my life
Knowing I join that bloody red.

Man, everything is heavy.

Silence, I'm dying.
